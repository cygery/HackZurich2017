HackZurich 2017 Project

This project is for research purposes only. It uses sophisticated algorithms to try to detect certain skin lesions. However, such approaches aren't fully accurate and can't replace a visit to the doctor. 

Use this project at your risk. None of it constitutes medical advice, diagnoses, or similar.
